# Pink
A Python bot I experimented with a few years ago and has now been resurrected as a complete rewrite. A bit lacking in features right now, but we'll get there.

Uses the Discord API from https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

The credentials.json used for authentication should look something like.
```
{
  "token": "discord bot token"
}
```
